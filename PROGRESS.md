# Project Progress: Hairstyle Visualization App

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: A web-based, mobile-optimized MVP for hairstylists to visualize hairstyles on client photos. Users upload a photo, swipe through predefined hairstyles, generate custom hairstyles via OpenAI’s DALL·E API, and save images to user accounts.  
**Tech Stack**:

- Frontend: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js (Express)
- Database/Storage: Supabase (auth, PostgreSQL, storage)
- Image Processing: Mediapipe (facial recognition), Sharp (image manipulation)
- AI: OpenAI API (DALL·E for hairstyle generation)
- Hosting: Vercel
- Development: Cursor (AI code editor)  
  **Design**: Matches Great Clips franchise website:
- Primary colors: Green (#00A651), white (#FFFFFF), dark gray (#333333)
- Secondary colors: Light gray (#F5F5F5), blue (#007BFF)
- Font: Inter (Google Fonts)
- Layout: Clean, grid-based, with rounded buttons and white cards  
  **Usability**: User-friendly for hairdressers, with a simple journey: upload photo, swipe hairstyles, generate custom style, save/share.  
  **Cost Goal**: Minimal, leveraging free tiers (Supabase: 1 GB storage, Vercel: 100 GB-hours, OpenAI: $5 credits) and open-source tools. Limit DALL·E API calls (~5 per user, $0–$10/month).  
  **Documentation**: This file tracks progress, tasks, errors, and rules, shared with Grok in new conversation windows to maintain continuity across multi-session development in /hairstyles-app.

## Files for Review

- [None yet; list files as needed, e.g., client/src/components/PhotoUpload.jsx]

## Current State

**Date**: May 9, 2025  
**Progress**: Set up Supabase authentication in Phase 2. Installed `@supabase/supabase-js` in both frontend (`/client`) and backend (`/server`). Verified Google login configuration in Supabase dashboard and Google Cloud Console, ensuring the redirect URI (`https://tzqjcusfzcpyzjkvtwrg.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`) is correctly set. Created Supabase clients in separate files: `/client/src/lib/supabaseClient.js` for frontend and `/server/supabaseClient.js` for backend. Tested initialization by logging the Supabase client objects in both frontend (`localhost:5173`) and backend (`localhost:5000`). Encountered a 404 error when navigating to `http://localhost:5000/` due to a missing root route; resolved by adding a temporary `/` route in `server.js`. Ready to create authentication routes in Express.  
**Blockers**: None  
**Environment**: Local (Node.js 20.19.1, npm 10.8.2, Cursor paid plan, localhost:5173, localhost:5000); GitHub (https://github.com/your-username/hairstyles-app); Supabase (https://tzqjcusfzcpyzjkvtwrg.supabase.co); Vercel (frontend: [frontend-url], backend: [backend-url]).  
**Errors**:

- [May 9, 2025]: "GET http://localhost:5000/ 404 (Not Found)" when navigating to the root URL. Fixed by adding a temporary root route (`/`) in `server.js` to return a welcome message.

## To-Do List

- Start Phase 2: User Authentication and Photo Storage.

## Build Process Rules

1. **Code vs. Prompt**: Provide code for starter files (e.g., tailwind.config.js); use Cursor prompts for complex tasks or if errors are unclear. Correct errors with full code if known, else provide a prompt to debug specific files. Use best judgment for minimal errors, favoring code for new files and prompts for project-context tasks.
2. **No Commented-Out Code**: Include clean code unless a specific file section is requested (e.g., “just the render method”).
3. **Clarify First**: Ask clarifying questions before providing code or prompts; deliver only requested items after answers. Proceed with best-guess for simple tasks (e.g., styling a button).
4. **Future Improvements**: Track high-level features (e.g., hairstyle gallery) and technical optimizations (e.g., WebP images) in FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md, prioritizing cost-free ideas but noting paid features with costs (e.g., AR API, $50/month).
5. **Error Handling**: Track errors and Cursor fixes in PROGRESS.md’s Current State or Errors section. Analyze Cursor’s solutions to improve code accuracy (e.g., “Learned useMemo for re-renders”).
6. **X Thread**: Suggest milestones for X posts to share in a thread after project completion, focusing on engaging, user-friendly tips for using Grok and Cursor (e.g., setting AI rules, Suna research). Keep posts fun, straightforward, and community-oriented, not step-by-step tutorials.
7. **Additional Rules**: Open to updates during the project, documented here.

## Future Improvements Implemented

- **Phase 1**:

  - **Use concurrently**: Added concurrently to run frontend and backend dev servers simultaneously from the root. Added `dev` script to /hairstyles-app/package.json. Tested with temporary server.js and existing frontend. Simplifies development with one command. (Cost: Free, npm install -g concurrently)

## Prompts

### Start New Conversation with Grok

Hi Grok, I’m continuing work on my hairstyle visualization app in a new conversation window. Please review the attached PROGRESS.md file (or pasted contents below) for the project’s context, progress, and tasks. The app is a web-based, mobile-optimized MVP for hairstylists to visualize hairstyles on client photos, using React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Node.js (Express), Supabase (auth, database, storage), Mediapipe, Sharp, OpenAI API (DALL·E), Vercel, and Cursor. The design matches the Great Clips franchise website (green #00A651, white #FFFFFF, dark gray #333333, light gray #F5F5F5, blue #007BFF; Inter font), and it’s user-friendly with a simple journey (upload, swipe, generate, save). We’re keeping costs minimal with free tiers and open-source tools.

**PROGRESS.md Contents**:  
[Paste or reference uploaded file, e.g., “See attached PROGRESS.md”]

**Current Task**:  
[Specify task, e.g., “Generate PhotoUpload.jsx with Great Clips styling”, “Review server/routes/upload.js for Multer errors”, “Update frontend.mdc with new rules”]

**Additional Context**:

- Refer to .cursor/rules/\*.mdc files for AI coding rules (e.g., frontend.mdc for React styling).
- Ensure code aligns with Great Clips’ clean, professional look and user-friendly design.
- Use cost-minimal approaches (e.g., client-side Mediapipe, limited OpenAI API calls).
- Update PROGRESS.md with task completion and status after each response.

Please provide the requested code, review, or guidance, and suggest how to update PROGRESS.md to reflect this work. Let me know if you need specific files or clarification.
