Project Progress: Hairstyle Visualization App
Project Overview
Purpose: A web-based, mobile-optimized MVP for hairstylists to visualize hairstyles on client photos. Users upload a photo, swipe through predefined hairstyles, generate custom hairstyles via OpenAI’s DALL·E API, and save images to user accounts.Tech Stack:

Frontend: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS  
Backend: Node.js (Express)  
Database/Storage: Supabase (auth, PostgreSQL, storage)  
Image Processing: Mediapipe (facial recognition), Sharp (image manipulation)  
AI: OpenAI API (DALL·E for hairstyle generation)  
Hosting: Vercel  
Development: Cursor (AI code editor)Design: Matches Great Clips franchise website (green #00A651, white #FFFFFF, dark gray #333333, Inter font, clean layout with rounded buttons and grid-based UI).Usability: User-friendly for hairdressers, with a simple journey: upload photo, swipe hairstyles, generate custom style, save/share.Cost Goal: Minimal, leveraging free tiers (Supabase, Vercel, OpenAI credits) and open-source tools. Limit DALL·E API calls to ~$0–$10/month.Documentation: This file tracks progress, tasks, errors, and rules, shared with Grok in new conversation windows.

Current State
**Date**: May 8, 2025
**Progress**: Implemented future improvement: added concurrently to run frontend (/client) and backend (/server) dev servers simultaneously from /hairstyles-app root. Installed concurrently globally and locally, updated root package.json with dev script. Tested with temporary server.js (localhost:5000) and existing frontend (localhost:5173). Auto-restart and hot-reload verified. Committed to GitHub. Ready for Node.js/Express backend setup with full configuration.
**Blockers**: None
**Environment**: Local development (Node.js 20.19.1, npm 10.8.2, Cursor paid plan, localhost:5173, localhost:5000); GitHub (https://github.com/your-username/hairstyles-app).
**Errors**:

- [May 8, 2025]: “npm error could not determine executable to run” when running `npx tailwindcss init -p`. Fixed by clearing npm cache and reinstalling dependencies.
- [May 8, 2025]: Same error with `npx tailwindcss --version` on Node.js 22.14.0 (tailwindcss@4.1.5). Downgraded to Node.js 20.x and reinstalled npm.
- [May 8, 2025]: Error persisted on Node.js 20.19.1. Fixed by resetting npm cache, setting registry to https://registry.npmjs.org/, reinstalling tailwindcss@3.4.1, and manually creating config files.
- [May 8, 2025]: “module is not defined in ES module scope” when running `npm run dev`. Cursor fixed by renaming postcss.config.js to postcss.config.cjs. Learned to use .cjs for CommonJS configs in Vite projects.

  To-Do List

Start Phase 1: Set up React with Vite and Tailwind CSS.  
Create FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md with initial format.  
Commit PROGRESS.md to GitHub.

Build Process Rules

Code vs. Prompt: Provide code for starter files; use Cursor prompts for complex tasks or if errors are unclear. Correct errors with full code if known, else provide a prompt to debug specific files.  
No Commented-Out Code: Include clean code unless a specific file section is requested.  
Clarify First: Ask clarifying questions before providing code or prompts; deliver only requested items after answers.  
Future Improvements: Track high-level features and technical optimizations in FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md, prioritizing cost-free ideas but noting paid features with costs.  
Error Handling: Track errors and Cursor fixes in PROGRESS.md’s Current State or Errors section. Analyze Cursor’s solutions to improve code accuracy.  
X Thread: Suggest milestones for X posts sharing engaging, user-friendly tips on using Grok and Cursor (e.g., setting rules, Suna research). Keep posts fun, straightforward, and community-oriented.  
Additional Rules: Open to updates during the project, documented here.

Prompts
Start New Conversation with Grok
Hi Grok, I’m continuing work on my hairstyle visualization app in a new conversation window. Please review the attached PROGRESS.md file (or pasted contents below) for the project’s context, progress, and tasks. The app is a web-based, mobile-optimized MVP for hairstylists to visualize hairstyles on client photos, using React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Node.js (Express), Supabase (auth, database, storage), Mediapipe, Sharp, OpenAI API (DALL·E), Vercel, and Cursor. The design matches the Great Clips franchise website (green #00A651, white #FFFFFF, dark gray #333333, Inter font), and it’s user-friendly with a simple journey (upload, swipe, generate, save). We’re keeping costs minimal with free tiers and open-source tools.

**PROGRESS.md Contents**:
[Paste or reference uploaded file, e.g., “See attached PROGRESS.md”]

**Current Task**:
[Specify task, e.g., “Generate PhotoUpload.jsx with Great Clips styling”, “Review server/routes/upload.js for Multer errors”, “Update frontend.mdc with new rules”]

## Future Improvements Implemented

- **Phase 1**:
  - **Add nodemon script**: Implemented nodemon for auto-restarting Express server during development. Added `dev` script to /server/package.json. Tested with temporary server.js. Saves time on server reloads. (Cost: Free, npm install -D nodemon)
  - **Use concurrently**: Added concurrently to run frontend and backend dev servers simultaneously from the root. Added `dev` script to /hairstyles-app/package.json. Tested with temporary server.js and existing frontend. Simplifies development with one command. (Cost: Free, npm install -g concurrently)

**Additional Context**:

- Refer to .cursor/rules/\*.mdc files for AI coding rules (e.g., frontend.mdc for React styling).
- Ensure code aligns with Great Clips’ clean, professional look and user-friendly design.
- Use cost-minimal approaches (e.g., client-side Mediapipe, limited OpenAI API calls).
- Update PROGRESS.md with task completion and status after each response.

Please provide the requested code, review, or guidance, and suggest how to update PROGRESS.md to reflect this work. Let me know if you need specific files or clarification.
